# Advanced Regression Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict a continuous target variable using advanced regression techniques. I explore and compare the performance of several regression models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Regressors. The project leverages stacking to combine model predictions and employs hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.


## Dataset Overview
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, featuring numerous predictors including city, open date, and various anonymized variables (P1 to P37), influencing the target variable.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean data and process categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
2. **Model Training**: Train individual regression models and evaluate their performance.
3. **Stacking**: Implement stacking with base models to improve predictions.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilize RandomizedSearchCV for optimal model parameters.
5. **Prediction**: Generate and export predictions for the test dataset.

## Results
Our analysis demonstrates the benefits of ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning in enhancing predictive accuracy in regression tasks.

## How to Use
